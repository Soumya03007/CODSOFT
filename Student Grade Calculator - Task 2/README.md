# CODSOFT Internship Project — Task 2

## Student Grade Calculator 📊

## 📌 Overview

This is a simple console-based Student Grade Calculator implemented in Java. The program takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts marks input for multiple subjects.

- Validates user input (marks must be between 0 and 100).

- Calculates:

    - 📘 Total Marks

    - 📗 Average Percentage

    - 📕 Grade (based on average percentage)

- Clear and structured result display.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User enters the total number of subjects.

2. User enters marks for each subject (validated between 0–100).

3. Program calculates:

    - Total Marks = Sum of all marks

    - Average Percentage = Total / Number of Subjects

    - Grade = Based on percentage achieved

4. Program displays results to the user.
